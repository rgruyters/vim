# VIM environment
My personal VIM settings, plugins and languages

## Usage
Clone the repository into your home folder.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/rgruyters/vim.git ~/.vim

Next is to create a `.vimrc` in your home folder that loads all the
settings.

    echo "source ~/.vim/vimrc" > ~/.vimrc

*NOTE*: This will override your owm configuration file.

Or you can copy the settings into your current file.
